  <br>
  Mysore was one of the three largest Princely States in the erstwhile
    British Empire of India. To this day, the Mysore Palace stands tall as
    one of the most spectacular palaces in India. A very famous tourist
    spot that sees thousands of visitors milling in and around it every
    day, the Mysore Palace is a mesmerizing example of IndoSaracenic architecture, every inch of the palace drips with opulence
    and intricate details, and every room that you visit stands out in
    terms of its elaborate architecture, beautiful paintings, rich colours
    and stained-glass windows. On every Sunday, and during the
    Dussehra celebrations, the palace is spectacularly lit up once dusk
    falls.

  <br>
  With its pristine beaches and breathtaking landscapes, Gokarna is
    a Hindu pilgrimage town in Karnataka and a newly found hub for
    beach lovers and hippies. Situated on the coast of Karwar, every
    year Gokarna welcomes hordes of tourists from around the world in
    search of sanctity and relaxation. The out-of-town beaches like
    Kudle beach and Om Beach are a different contrast to life inside the
    town.
    Palm clad beaches are dotted with foreign tourists in a majority and
    very few Indians are seen across. Gokarna is not very
    conventionally touristy. The beaches are meant for a slow, relaxed
    holiday and everything on the beach goes at the same relaxed
    pace. Full of coconut and palm trees, the ocean and clean sands,
    Gokarna is a 'one of a kind' place in the country.
