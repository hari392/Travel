<p class="para1">
  West Bengal is the fourth most populous state in India. It
  is also the seventh most populous sub-national entity in the
  world. West Bengal is the sixth largest contributor to India's
  GDP. Both West Bengal and Bangladesh are parts of
  historical and geographic region of Bengal.

  <br>
  Kolkata, India's second biggest city, is a perpetually ongoing festival
  of human existence, concurrently luxurious and squalid, refined and
  frantic, pointedly futuristic, while beautifully in decay. A vibrant 350-
  year-old metropolis located on India's Eastern Coast, the capital of
  West Bengal thrives on contradictions and imposing spectacles;
  nothing is commonplace in this city. Famously known as the City of
  Joy, Kolkata is, in every sense, the artistic, cultural and intellectual
  capital of the country. Kolkata's streets are vivid, hectic, chaotic,
  and yet, brimming with life and creativity. Driven by the indomitable
  spirit of the self-made middle class, the city has created a beautiful
  juxtaposition of the old colonial-era charm with the nascent
  upcoming hipster culture that thrives amongst the city's millennial
  residents.

  <br>
  The previous summer capital of India under the British Raj,
Darjeeling has come off age as one of the most sought after hill
stations in India. Located in West Bengal, this scenic hill station is
the perfect getaway for a romantic honeymoon. Nestled amidst
acres of tea plantations, Darjeeling stands at the height of 2,050
meters above sea level, thus boasting a cool climate all year round.

  <br>
  Often touted as the Steel Capital of East India, Durgapur is the embodiment
  of the quintessential Bengali town. With a total population of less than half a
  million, Durgapur is in the Burdwan District of West Bengal, on the bank of
  the Damodar River. It is about 170 kms from the city of Kolkata.
