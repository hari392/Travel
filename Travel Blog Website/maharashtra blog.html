  <br>
  Mumbai, the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra, is a spectacular paradox of chaos and hope, glamour and squalor, modernity and tradition.
Famously known as the City of Dreams, Mumbai – formerly known as Bombay.
- Mumbai is a beautifully blended melting pot of cultures and lifestyles.

  <br>
  Cultural capital of Maharashtra, Pune holds a place of pride in every Marathi’s heart. Once a political centre of the Indian sub-continent, Pune was the seat of Peshwas of the Maratha Empire.
The district alone boasts of 17 forts of which the most famous are Shaniwar Wada, Singhagad Fort and Purandar Fort, closely followed by a remarkably different looking Aga Khan Palace that served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi soon after he launched the Quit India movement.
Pune is a heaven for an art, culture and adventure lover.

  <br>
  Located between Mumbai and Pune, this beautiful hill station offers a quick getaway from the rushed city life.
Famous for mouth-watering chikki (Indian candy made of nuts set in jaggery or sugar syrup), Lonavala offers a scenic drive from both cities.
The beautiful winding roads and long tunnels on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway is a reason enough to keep going back to Lonavala.
While Lonavala itself is a very small hill station, it is surrounded by some of the best tourist places in Maharashtra such as Pawna Lake, Lohagarh Fort, Visapur Fort, Tiger’s Point, Bhaja Caves, Kune Falls and Shree Narayani Dham Temple.
You can also enjoy camping and trekking in Lonavala.
