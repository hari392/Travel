<p class="para1">
  Kerala is divided into three geographical regions: Highlands, which slope
  down from the Western Ghats onto the Midlands of undulating hills and
  valleys into an unbroken 580 km long coastline with many picturesque
  backwaters, interconnected with canals and rivers. The wild lands are
  covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee
  plantations or other forms of cultivation. Most of the state is engulfed in rich
  greenery which ensures a very calming experience at all times.

  <br>
  Munnar, the famed hill station of south India, is a romantic locale
  where natural beauty is everywhere to visit, explore and to enjoy.
  Munnar is situated at the confluence of three mountain streams –
  Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala – and the word ‘Munnar’
  means three rivers in Malayalam. Situated about 1600m above sea
  level, the hill station had been the summer resort of the British
  Government during the colonial era. Imprints of the colonial past
  stand tall in the Munnar town in the form of English country
  cottages. Virgin forests, savannah, rolling hills, scenic valleys,
  numerous streams, huge splashy waterfalls, sprawling tea
  plantations and winding walkways are all part of the great holiday
  experience on offer for a traveler to Munnar. Munnar is also known
  for Neelakurinji, a rare plant which flowers only once in twelve
  years. The ‘kurinji season’ in Munnar is a magnificent sight when
  the hills and valleys get bathed in the blue of the Neelakurinji
  blooms.
